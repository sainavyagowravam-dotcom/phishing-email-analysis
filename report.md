# Phishing Email Analysis Report

## Objective
To analyze a suspicious email sample and identify phishing characteristics.

## 1. Sender Email Analysis

The sender email address is:

support@paypa1.com

The domain name uses the number “1” instead of the letter “l” in PayPal.  
The legitimate company is PayPal and its official domain is paypal.com.

This indicates email spoofing, which is a common phishing technique used to trick users into trusting fake emails.

## 2. Subject Line Analysis

The subject line says:

"Urgent! Your Account Will Be Suspended"

This creates panic and forces the recipient to act quickly.  
Phishing emails often use urgent or threatening language to pressure victims.

## 3. Suspicious Link Analysis

The email contains the following link:

http://paypal-account-security.verify-user.com

Issues identified:
- The domain does not match the official PayPal website.
- The URL is misleading.
- It attempts to look legitimate but redirects to a fake domain.

This type of link is commonly used to steal login credentials.

## 4. Generic Greeting

The email begins with:

"Dear Customer"

Legitimate companies usually address customers by their registered name.  
Generic greetings are commonly used in phishing emails sent to many people.

## 5. Social Engineering Techniques

The email uses:
- Fear (account suspension)
- Urgency (24-hour deadline)
- Threat (permanent suspension)

These techniques are examples of social engineering, where attackers manipulate emotions to trick users into revealing sensitive information.

## Conclusion

The analyzed email contains multiple phishing indicators including:
- Spoofed sender address
- Suspicious link
- Urgent language
- Generic greeting
- Social engineering tactics

Based on these indicators, this email is clearly a phishing attempt.
